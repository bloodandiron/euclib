	This project is licensed under the GPL, which is located in the file
	"LICENSE".

about:
	Generic 2D geometry library providing points, lines, polygons, and many
	helper functions including (when it's done) transformations, combinations,
	and intersections.
	
note on compilation:
	This project is partially an exploration of the new C++0X language features
	by myself, and thus this project extensively uses C++0X constructs and
	language features, most notably:
		rvalue references
		variadic templates
		static_cast
		intializer lists
		auto
	if you do not use the included makefile, make sure you are using at least
	gcc 4.5 with the -std=c++0x flag or a compiler that will support these
	features.  Additionally, I will most likely be including at least some
	boost dependencies in the future, so having the boost libraries will
	soon become a requirement.

usage:
	Since this is a generic library, it will most likely need only header file
	includes to integrate properly.  The header file "euclib.hpp" includes all
	of the other files needed, or you can include them individually as needed.
